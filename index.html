<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Our Advocacy chapter of the American Association of University Professors</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b><i>What is the purpose of this Advocacy Chapter?</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">To provide a local and national collective voice for academic freedom and shared governance.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">To defend professional values and standards and the economic security and professional status of all those engaged in teaching and research at Missouri State University and throughout academe; and to ensure the university's contribution to the common good.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">To facilitate the cooperation and mutual support of teachers and research scholars, encourage faculty participation in shared governance at Missouri State University, and support the dissemination of information relating to higher education principles and best practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b><i>What do we do?</i></b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Advocacy Chapter provides a collective faculty voice to speak for your and your colleagues' interests and to communicate to administration policies and practices supported by the broader higher education community. Soft power works: None of us are stronger or louder than all of us, and having a sizable national organization behind us gives our voice additional weight, legitimacy, and teeth. You and your colleagues can organize to work for the changes you want.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Academic disciplines have standards. Higher education is not a business. Tenure serves a purpose. Contingent faculty should be compensated fairly. Social justice is good for society. Organization and collective strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 18.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; line-height: 40.7px; font: 33.9px Georgia; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: #262626"><span class="s3">Here For You</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3">You and your faculty colleagues need a collective voice and mutual support in all times and climates.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>Why now? Is it because of the [fill in the blank]? </i></b>Although the university is going through a great deal of change currently (as is the case across the country), the founding of this organization is not intended as a reactionary answer to any particular event or administrative decision, but is meant to be present in a continuous way and be adaptive to respond to whatever comes to pass.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>Is it safe?</i>:</b> Absolutely. Federal law prohibits employers from retaliating against any employee (regardless of their citizenship or visa status) for joining a union (or advocacy chapter). If you are feeling insecure about this, note the stability and success of the Missouri NEA and AFT organizations.</span><span class="s1"><br>
</span><span class="s3">In the past some faculty have had concerns about a 1947 decision that ruled that rights to collectively bargain did not apply to public employees; that decision was overturned in 2007. Even in "right-to-work" states, one may join or support unions (these laws simply mean that unions can not require employees to join).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>Can I join?</i></b> Membership is open to current and retired faculty members/ instructors and graduate students at MSU. Get on the e-mail <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKo3lU583KMg3U47VbKBgzUlJp13AMxX6lVCfxC94Pbmmf0w/viewform"><span class="s4">contact list.</span></a></span><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>What are the more concrete benefits of membership?:</i></b></span><span class="s1"><br>
</span><span class="s3">In additional to mutual support, networking, and a collective voice with faculty across campus and the country, it provides you access to professional liability insurance (starting at $75/year-- might be of interest to scholars with research interests that might ruffle feathers), some legal services (see above), 30% off The Chronicle, and a range of similar benefits via the affiliation with AFT (help with applying for PSLF program, hotel and car rental discounts, credit union, college scholarship opportunities for dependents, etc.).</span><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>What are the yearly dues?:</i></b> Dues are determined by one's academic income: ballpark for the majority of MSU educators would be between $10 and $24/month (perhaps less for some instructional roles, slightly more for those at the high end of salaries). The local chapter at this time has no additional dues.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>What is the connection between the MoState AAUP Chapter and the MSU Faculty Senate?:</i></b> Faculty Senate has its own protocols, ways of operating, and priorities, and serves a range of standing institutional goals and procedures, which take up much of its time and attention. The chapter provides an additional voice for you and your colleagues independent of the administrative structure of the university.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b><i>What is the connection between AAUP and the AFT and AFL-CIO?:</i></b> In 2022 the AAUP voted to affiliate with the AFT, which in turn is an affiliate of the AFL-CIO. Other than the greater collective voice for academia and education professionals in broad terms that the relationship offers, and the weight of the larger family of labor organizations, it extends some AFT benefits to AAUP members. <a href="https://www.aaup.org/faqs-aaupaft-affiliation"><span class="s6">More information.</span></a>.</span></p>
